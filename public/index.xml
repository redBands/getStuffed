      <description>Coleslaw kimchi “A delicious take on classic coleslaw but without the mayonnaise and with more of a kick to it. Goes perfectly with a piece of grilled fish or meat, on your sandwich or as a side dish. Together with a few green leaves and some veg the coleslaw is quickly transformed into a filling salad. ”
Ingredients 600g white cabbage 200g leek 100g carrot 2 tablespoons gochugaru , (Korean chilli powder) 1 teaspoon grated garlic 1 teaspoon grated ginger 1 tablespoon distilled vinegar , (12%) 2 tablespoons sesame oil 1-2 teaspoons salt ½-1 tablespoon granulated sugar</description>

      <description>Scrambled eggs with beans
These Scrambled Eggs with Beans, known as Revuelto con Alubias Blancas, are possibly one of the most underrated dishes ever. We’re talking a ton of great flavors, seriously easy to make and all done in just 20 minutes. Serve them for breakfast or even for dinner, and always next to some Catalan Tomato Bread.
To make this recipe, I used canned white beans. Just to make this quicker and easier.</description>

      <description>Minced Turkey Chilli
Pour 2 tbsp of olive or groundnut oil into a wide, shallow pan and place over a high heat. As the oil starts to sizzle, crumble in 500g of minced turkey. Let the mince brown deeply on the underside before tuning it over (stirring will stop the meat browning). Continue cooking for 4 or 5 minutes until nicely browned all over.
While the meat browns, peel and finely chop 1 medium to large onion.</description>
