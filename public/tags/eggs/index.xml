      <description>Scrambled eggs with beans
These Scrambled Eggs with Beans, known as Revuelto con Alubias Blancas, are possibly one of the most underrated dishes ever. We’re talking a ton of great flavors, seriously easy to make and all done in just 20 minutes. Serve them for breakfast or even for dinner, and always next to some Catalan Tomato Bread.
To make this recipe, I used canned white beans. Just to make this quicker and easier.</description>
