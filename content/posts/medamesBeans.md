Prep **10 min, plus soaking time if using dried**
Cook **20 min-70 min, depending on the type of bean**
Serves **4-6**

**400g small dried fava beans**, or 2 x 400g tins
**1 tsp cumin seeds**
**2-4 garlic cloves**, peeled
**Salt**
**2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil**, plus extra to serve
**1 large onion**, peeled and finely chopped
**2 tomatoes**, chopped
**1 green chilli**, finely chopped (optional)
**1 lemon**
**1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley**

If using dried beans, soak them overnight in plenty of cold water, then drain. Put in a large pan and add cold water to cover by about 3cm. Put on the lid, bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and simmer gently until soft – depending on the age of the beans, this should take at least an hour. Alternatively, drain the tinned beans into a large pan with about half of their liquid (reserve the rest), then heat up gently.
Once the beans are almost ready, toast the cumin seeds in a dry frying pan until aromatic, then tip into a mortar, add the garlic and a pinch of coarse salt, and pound to a paste (alternatively, use a garlic crusher or sharp knife).

Put the oil in the same frying pan on a medium heat, then fry the onion until softened.
Add the tomato and chilli, if using, and fry for another five or so minutes, until the tomato has broken down.

If there’s still a lot of liquid left in the beans, uncover the pan, turn up the heat and reduce until the mix begins to take on a saucy consistency (conversely, if they’re very dry, add more water).
Mash about a quarter of the beans to help thicken the sauce, then stir in the onions, tomatoes and garlic paste, and cook gently, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes, adding more liquid, especially when using tinned beans, if the mix looks too dry. Add a squeeze of lemon juice and season to taste.

Serve sprinkled with chopped flat-leaf parsley and more extra-virgin olive oil, with warm flatbreads, lemon wedges, salad, pickles and so on on the side as desired.
