[Butter Beans Cannellini and Cavolo Nero](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/nov/26/nigel-slater-recipes-fo-butter-beans-cannellini-and-cavolo-nero-and-chocolate-and-orange-frangipane)

Beans in jars are more plump and juicy than those in tins, but either works well here. It is essential to include some of the aquafaba – the bottling liquor. It adds a creamy quality without the need for any dairy produce. Serves 2

**cavolo nero** 150g
**hispi (pointed) cabbage** 200g
**garlic** 2 plump cloves
**olive oil** 2 tbsp
**dill** 2 tbsp
**butter beans** 400g
**cannellini beans** 250g
**lemon** 1

Trim the tough ends of the cavolo nero stalks, then place the leaves on top of one another, roll tightly, then slice them into wide shreds, like pappardelle. Repeat with the pointed cabbage. Have a bowl of iced water to hand.

Put a pan of water on to boil and, when boiling, dunk the cavolo nero in, leave for 2 minutes, then lift it out and transfer to the iced water. When the water returns to the boil, repeat with the cabbage.

Peel the garlic, then crush to a paste with a good pinch of salt – use a pestle and mortar, but the flat side of a knife and a chopping board works, too. In a wide sauté or frying pan, warm the oil and garlic paste. You don’t want the garlic to colour, so stir as it warms and softens. Finely chop the dill and stir into the garlic.


Tip the butter beans and cannellini together with their liquor into the pan and stir to coat them with the oil and garlic. Leave over a moderate heat, covered by a lid, for a few minutes until the beans are hot. Finely grate the lemon zest and squeeze the juice.

Season the beans generously with salt and black pepper, then stir in the lemon zest and, if you wish, a little of the juice. Drain the greens thoroughly, stir them into the beans and heat through briefly before spooning on to deep plates.
