[Nigellas Parmesan French Toast](https://www.nigella.com/recipes/parmesan-french-toast)

**INGREDIENTS**
Serves: 1-2

1 large egg
3 x 15ml tablespoons finely grated Parmesan
¼ teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
3 x 15ml tablespoons full fat milk
2 slices white sourdough bread or anything sturdy and with a bit of bite to it
1 x 15ml tablespoon unsalted butter
½ teaspoon regular olive oil

**TO SERVE:**

flatleaf parsley
spring onions

**METHOD**
1. Whisk the egg, Parmesan, paprika, mustard, Worcestershire sauce and milk together in a shallow dish that the slices of bread will fit in with not a great deal of space around them, making sure everything is completely combined.
2. Sit the bread in this sunny mixture for about 2 minutes each side, pressing down on it every now and again. You want the slices to be soaked through and softened, but not falling to pieces. Spoon any remaining egg mixture over.
3. When the bread is ready, warm the butter and oil in a frying pan in which the slices will sit fairly snugly. Once the butter is beginning to bubble frothily, fry the bread over a medium-high heat, turning it down if the butter gets too hot, for about 2 minutes each side — keep a good eye on it — until it is cooked through with patches of rich golden brown on the surface.
4. Remove from the pan, and eat just as it is, or sprinkle with chopped parsley and thinly sliced spring onion, if wished.
