[Chili Chicken and Beans](https://www.allrecipes.com/chili-bean-chicken-recipe-8676837)

### Ingredients
- 1 cup roasted tomato salsa

- 1/2 cup ketchup

- 1/4 cup BBQ sauce

- 2 tablespoons yellow mustard

- 1/3 cup apple cider vinegar

- 1/4 cup packed brown sugar

- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

- 3/4 cup water

- 2 (15 ounce) cans pinto beans

- 2 (15 ounce) cans cannellini beans

- 2 tablespoons chili powder

- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika

- 1 teaspoon ground cumin

- 1 teaspoon garlic powder

- 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

- 2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste

- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste

- 1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano

- 1/2 cup sliced green onions, plus more for garnish

- 8 large skinless, boneless chicken thighs

### Directions
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Add all the ingredients except chicken—salsa, ketchup, BBQ sauce, mustard, vinegar, brown sugar, Worcestershire, water, pinto beans, cannellini beans, chili powder, smoked paprika, cumin, garlic powder, black pepper, salt, cayenne, oregano, and green onions—to a large bowl, and stir very thoroughly to combine.

Pour chili mixture into a 15x10-inch casserole dish. Use a spoon to make sure beans are evenly distributed.

Add chicken thighs one at a time; unfold each chicken thigh, toss thoroughly in the sauce, then fold back up into a compact thigh shape. Space the 8 thighs evenly, and poke down into the sauce until almost submerged.

Bake in the preheated oven until liquids have reduced and thickened slightly, and the thighs are fork tender, about 1 1/2 hours.

Let rest for 10 minutes before serving. Top with more green onions if desired.
