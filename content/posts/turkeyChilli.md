[Minced Turkey Chilli](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/dec/12/nigel-slater-recipe-minced-turkey-chilli)

Pour 2 tbsp of **olive** or **groundnut oil** into a wide, shallow pan and place over a high heat. As the oil starts to sizzle, crumble in **500g of minced turkey**. Let the mince brown deeply on the underside before tuning it over (stirring will stop the meat browning). Continue cooking for 4 or 5 minutes until nicely browned all over.

While the meat browns, peel and finely chop 1 medium to large **onion**. Remove the meat from the pan with a draining spoon and set aside. Return the pan to the heat, stir the onion into the meat juices and oil in the pan and let it fry for 7-8 minutes until soft and lightly coloured.

Stir in 2 level tsp of **mild ground chilli**, 2 tsp of your favourite **curry powder** and 2 tbsp of **chilli sauce**. Roughly chop **250g of tomatoes** and stir into the onions. Continue cooking for a few minutes until the tomatoes have collapsed and the onion is translucent. Return the meat and any juices to the pan and stir together. Drain and add a **400g tin of haricot beans**, then season generously with salt and pepper and continue simmering for a further 5-7 minutes.

Stir in 2 or 3 tbsp of **soured cream** or **crème fraîche**, 1 tbsp of **chilli sauce** to taste and a little chopped **coriander**. *Enough for 4 served with rice*

- The browning of the mince is what gives the real flavour to this dish. Once the meat goes into the pan, leave it be, without stirring, until the underside has browned, then stir and break up the meat with a wooden spoon and again leave until that side has browned, too. Without this essential browning the dish will lack depth of flavour.

- This is a good way to use over-ripe or lacklustre tomatoes. As they cook, squash them with your wooden spoon to release their juices, letting them mingle with the meat juices in the pan.
