Makes **2 x 500g jars**

**500g brussels sprouts**, and/or other greens
**250g mixed seasonal vegetables** (eg, carrots, jerusalem artichokes, squash, turnip, kohlrabi)
**100g dark green leek tops or spring onions**
**Sea salt**
**4 tbsp brown rice**, or white rice flour, gluten-free flour or wheat flour
**6 garlic cloves**, peeled
**1 small red or white onion**, peeled
**4 tbsp gochujang**, or Korean chilli powder or red chilli flakes
**50ml fish sauce**

Cut all the sprouts in half and put in a large bowl. Cut the mixed vegetables and leek tops or spring onions into matchsticks, and add to the bowl. Cover with cold water and season with plenty of sea salt so it tastes as salty as the sea. Leave for two hours, then drain in a colander.

Meanwhile, with a high-speed blender or spice mill, grind the brown rice into flour and tip into a small saucepan (if you don’t have any brown rice, use four tablespoons of ready-made white rice flour, wheat flour or gluten-free flour instead). Whisk in 400ml water, put on a medium heat and cook, stirring, for a few minutes, until the mix thickens and starts to bubble. Simmer for another minute until it turns into an opaque porridge, then take off the heat.

Put the garlic, onion, gochujang and fish sauce (or water) in a blender, add the porridgey rice mix and blitzto a puree. Transfer to a large bowl, add the drained vegetables and with clean hands, toss to coat. Pack into clean jars, pushing the vegetables under the liquid, then seal and leave at room temperature for at least four days, until it starts to bubble and ferment; open the jars once a day, to release excess gases and “burp” the kimchi.
