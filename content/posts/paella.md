**Ingredients**
- 2 litres hot chicken stock (I used 2 Kallo organic chicken stock cubes)
- Pinch saffron
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 onion sliced
- 100 g chorizo sliced or diced
- 400 g chicken thigh fillets no bone or skin, cut into 2cm chunks
- 3 cloves garlic crushed or grated
- Â½ to 1 teaspoon dried chilli flakes (or to taste)
- 3 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1 red pepper sliced
- 2 medium tomatoes roughly chopped
- 300 g paella rice
- Salt and pepper
- 100 g frozen peas
- 2 lemons cut into quarters
- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley plus extra for garnish

**Instructions**
Add the saffron to the hot chicken stock, stir thoroughly and and set aside.
Place the olive oil in a large, wide pan and add the onion, cover with a lid and cook over a gentle heat for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Remove the lid and add the chorizo and chicken, fry over a medium-high heat for 2 minutes.
Turn down the heat and add the garlic, chilli and paprika. Cook for 2 more minutes.
Add the red pepper, tomatoes, paella rice and chicken stock, plus some salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, then turn down and simmer for 15 minutes, with the lid off.
Add the frozen peas and cook for a further 5 minutes. By this time all the stock should have all been absorbed.
Finally stir in the juice from 2 of the lemon quarters and the chopped parsley. Serve scattered with more parsley and with the remaining lemon quarters.
